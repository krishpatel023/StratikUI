    <Title className="text-3xl mb-4">Installation</Title>

    To begin with the installation we use the turborepo for maintaining the entire monorepo. Additional details of the file structure are described below in the file structure section.
    Follow the following steps to install and run the project steadily:

    <span className="text-primary-foreground text-lg">Step 1: Clone the repository</span>
    <CODE>
    ```bash|bash
    git clone https://github.com/krishpatel023/StratikUI.git
    ```
    </CODE>

    <span className="text-primary-foreground text-lg mt-4">Step 2: Install it like a normal repo</span>
    <CODE>
    ```bash|bash
    npm install
    ```
    </CODE>

    <span className="text-primary-foreground text-lg mt-4">Step 3: Setup the env variables</span>

    Go the apps/web/ and create `.env.local` and copy the following there

    <CODE>
    ```apps/web/.env.local|bash
    NODE_ENV=development
    NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV=development
    NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=test_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://posthog.com
    ```
    </CODE>

    <span className="text-primary-foreground text-lg mt-4">Step 4: Run the dev command</span>

    <CODE>
    ```bash|bash
    turbo dev
    ```
    </CODE>
    This will start two servers the first one will be on [Port 3000](http://localhost:3000) if no other server is running and the other one will be on [Port 3001](http://localhost:3001). The post 3000 runs the internal registry where you can test all the components you create and the port 3001 will be the main website of Stratik UI.

    <Title className="text-3xl mb-4">Technology used </Title>

    We use turborepo to manage our monorepo. There are mainly two applications:
    ## Registry

    It is built using Next 14.2 along with tailwind and typescript. The `src/packages` folder contains the source code of the components that are present in the Stratik UI Library.
    It uses tsx for running custom scripts with ES6 module system than CommanJS module system.

    ## Web

    The web contains the entire documentation website and the homepage as well. It uses Next 14.2, TailwindCSS, MDX, and Posthog for analytics. It also contains framer-motion, container-queries, fuse.js for searching, shiki for code highlighting and much more.
