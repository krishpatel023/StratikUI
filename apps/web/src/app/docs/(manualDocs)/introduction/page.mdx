### Key Features

- **Customizable**: Our copy-paste based approach allows you to easily modify and own your components.

- **Styling + Functionality**: We provide both the visual design and the underlying functionality, but you have full control to modify either as needed.

- **Custom Hooks**: Enhance your development workflow with our collection of useful hooks.

- **Open Source**: Freely available for use, modification, and distribution under [MIT License](https://github.com/krishpatel023/StratikUI/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Our Vision
</PARTITION>

We aim to create a comprehensive library of essential UI components within a year. Our goal is to build a vast collection of designed components that are well designed and are functional. We aim to reduce the time it takes to build a website or application by providing a library of components that can be used out of the box.
